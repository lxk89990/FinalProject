Abstract—Due to large amounts of greenhouse gasses being
released into the air there is an increasing trend of Global
warming.One of the major causes of nonseasonal rains is Global
warming.With the nonseasonal rains main industries that will be
affected are agricultural.Along with the agricultural industry the
economy and life of the people also will be at the stake.Predicting
the rainfall at a particular location is depends on the atmospheric
parameters specific to that area.In general the meteorology
department predicts the rainfall using different methods. These
methods are not accessible to other people. While predicting
they consider atmospheric parameters into consideration.Based
on the past and present data they observe the patterns and make
an educated guess to predict the rain.But there is quantitative
method to measure the probability of the guess.Machine learning
offers forecasting models with the given data.The advantage of
using machine learning models gives us quantitative analysis.We
can predict the accuracy of the classes and different visualizations
to filter the outliers in the data and data cleaning.In this
paper we classify or forecast the rainfall using meteorological parameters using machine learning techniques.Our project
is a binary classification problem.The features of the project
include ensemble models and SMOTE oversampling methods.
SMOTE balances the imbalance classes for better prediction
results.Machine learning Decision tree, Gradient Boosting, Ada
Boosting and K-Means clustering algorithms are used to predict
next-day rain by training classification models on the target
variable Rain Tomorrow. In this paper we have used weather
AUS dataset which is collected from kaggle repository.
